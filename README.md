# CancellingRetrofitRequests
 
Android app showing usage of retrofit for fetching data and making multiple requests at same time while cancelling all previous requests and accepting only current/last request's response.
Also showing use of retrofit with kotlin coroutine.

Code in this project is written in both Java & Kotlin. So anyone having experience in any of the language can see their relative code.

To run Java code go to manifest file and change default activity to reflect one in 'java' directory and to run kotlin's code change directory to kotlin.
